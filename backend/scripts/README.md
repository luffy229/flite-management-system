# Flight Booking System Scripts

This directory contains utility scripts for managing the flight booking system database.

## Available Scripts

### 1. `seedFlights.js`
**Purpose**: Seeds the database with initial flight data
**Usage**: `npm run seed`
**When to use**: 
- Initial database setup
- When you want to reset all flight data

### 2. `generateSeats.js`
**Purpose**: Generates seats for ALL flights (including existing ones)
**Usage**: `npm run generate-seats`
**When to use**: 
- When you want to regenerate seats for all flights
- After clearing the seats collection
- When seat structure needs to be updated

### 3. `generateSeatsForNewFlights.js`
**Purpose**: Generates seats ONLY for flights that don't have seats yet
**Usage**: `npm run generate-seats-new`
**When to use**: 
- After adding new flights to the database
- When you want to add seats to new flights without affecting existing ones
- **This is the recommended script for adding seats to new flights**

## How to Add New Flights

### Method 1: Using the seed script (Recommended for bulk additions)
1. Add your new flights to `seedFlights.js`
2. Run `npm run seed` to add flights to database
3. Run `npm run generate-seats-new` to create seats for the new flights

### Method 2: Manual addition
1. Add flights directly to the database (via API or MongoDB client)
2. Run `npm run generate-seats-new` to create seats for flights without seats

## Script Features

- **Smart Detection**: Scripts automatically detect which flights already have seats
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling with detailed logging
- **Progress Tracking**: Shows progress and summary of operations
- **Safe Operation**: Won't duplicate seats for flights that already have them

## Example Output

```
Connected to MongoDB
Found 5 flights
Flight 6E 101 already has 72 seats - skipping
Flight AI 220 already has 48 seats - skipping
Creating seats for flight SG 310...
âœ… Created 39 seats for flight SG 310
Creating seats for flight UK 415...
âœ… Created 92 seats for flight UK 415

ðŸŽ‰ Seat generation completed!
ðŸ“Š Summary:
   - Flights processed: 2
   - Total seats created: 131
   - Flights skipped (already have seats): 3
Disconnected from MongoDB
```

## Important Notes

- Always run `generate-seats-new` after adding new flights
- The scripts assume 6 seats per row (A-F configuration)
- Seats are generated based on the `totalSeats` field in the Flight model
- Scripts are safe to run multiple times (won't create duplicate seats)
